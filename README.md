# üèüÔ∏è Events Alert System (EAS)

The **Events Alert System (EAS)** is a Python-based Telegram bot that automatically sends daily game alerts for your favorite teams.  
It‚Äôs designed to run continuously on a Raspberry Pi and start automatically when the system boots.

---

## ‚öΩ Features

- Sends **daily Telegram alerts** for your favorite teams (Braves, Falcons, Hawks, Atlanta United, USMNT, Costa Rica, etc.)
- Pulls real-time data from **TheSportsDB API**
- Automatically sends:
  - **10 AM ET** ‚Üí Today‚Äôs games  
  - **8 PM ET** ‚Üí Tomorrow‚Äôs games
- Runs 24/7 using **systemd** for automatic startup
- Compatible with **Python 3.13**
- Uses a **Python virtual environment (venv)** for isolated dependencies
- Fully self-contained and portable ‚Äî no global package changes

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (or any Debian-based Linux)
- Python **3.13+**
- Internet connection
- Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps carefully to set up the bot from scratch.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository**

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EventsAlertSystem.git
cd EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system


---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Python virtual environment

A virtual environment isolates your project‚Äôs dependencies from system-wide Python packages.

python3 -m venv venv

This creates a folder called venv/ inside your project directory containing its own copy of Python and pip.


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

You should now see (venv) before your terminal prompt, meaning the venv is active.


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

Install all required packages from the provided requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once complete, deactivate the environment:

deactivate


---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the installation

You can manually start the script to ensure it runs correctly:

source venv/bin/activate
python events_alert_system.py

If no errors appear, press Ctrl + C to stop it, then deactivate:

deactivate


---

üì¶ requirements.txt

This file defines all packages needed by the bot.
It‚Äôs preconfigured for Python 3.13 compatibility.

python-telegram-bot==13.15
urllib3<2
filetype
schedule
pytz
requests

Why these versions?

python-telegram-bot==13.15 ‚Üí legacy API with Updater, Filters, etc.

urllib3<2 ‚Üí restores contrib.appengine removed in urllib3 v2+

filetype ‚Üí replacement for deprecated imghdr

schedule, pytz, requests ‚Üí used for scheduling, time zones, and API calls



---

üí¨ Telegram Configuration

1. Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.


2. Send /newbot and follow the instructions to create a new bot.


3. Copy the API token you receive.


4. Open your bot script (events_alert_system.py) and paste your token:



BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"

Save the file.


---

üîÅ Set Up Automatic Startup with systemd

This ensures the bot starts automatically when your Raspberry Pi boots.


---

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a systemd service file

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/events-alert.service

Paste this configuration:

[Unit]
Description=Events Alert System
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=amorawa3
WorkingDirectory=/home/amorawa3/EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system
ExecStart=/home/amorawa3/EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system/venv/bin/python /home/amorawa3/EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system/events_alert_system.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust the username (amorawa3) and paths if your directory differs.




---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable and start the service

Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable events-alert.service
sudo systemctl start events-alert.service


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check service status

To verify the bot is running:

sudo systemctl status events-alert.service

You should see a green ‚Äúactive (running)‚Äù status.


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ View real-time logs

journalctl -u events-alert.service -f

To stop or restart the service:

sudo systemctl stop events-alert.service
sudo systemctl restart events-alert.service


---

üß© How the Virtual Environment Works

The venv is a self-contained sandbox containing its own Python and libraries.

ExecStart in the systemd file directly points to your venv‚Äôs Python binary.

You never need to manually ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the venv for the service ‚Äî systemd handles it automatically.


This setup ensures:

No interference with system Python packages.

Predictable, stable operation even after OS or Python updates.



---

üîÑ Updating the Bot or Dependencies

If you modify the code or update dependencies:

cd ~/EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
deactivate
sudo systemctl restart events-alert.service


---

ü©µ Troubleshooting

Problem	Cause	Fix

No module named imghdr	Python 3.13 removed imghdr	Fixed via filetype dependency
cannot import name 'Filters'	Using PTB v20+ with old code	Pin PTB to 13.15
No module named urllib3.contrib.appengine	urllib3 v2+ removed that submodule	Downgrade with urllib3<2
Service won‚Äôt start	Wrong path in systemd file	Double-check paths and username



---

üß† Developer Notes

The system runs two daily checks:

10 AM ET ‚Üí today‚Äôs games

8 PM ET ‚Üí tomorrow‚Äôs games


Built around schedule and pytz for reliable timing.

Game data is fetched from TheSportsDB.

Telegram messages are sent via python-telegram-bot API calls.



---

üß∞ Commands Summary

‚úÖ You can now copy **everything above** into your file  
`~/EventsAlertSystem/events-alert-system/README.md`  

Would you like me to also include a small ready-to-copy `events-alert.service` file and a `requirements-freeze.txt` (based on the exact versions currently installed in your venv) to ensure perfect reproducibility if you ever reinstall?
